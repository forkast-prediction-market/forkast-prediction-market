<Callout type="warning">
  Always edit a local copy of `.env.example` and import the finished file in Vercel. It keeps your secrets versioned and avoids typos in the dashboard.
</Callout>

## Required for production

| Variable | Why it matters | How to obtain it |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `FEE_RECIPIENT_WALLET` | Routes your fork's trading fees (defaults to 1% unless you change it in admin settings). | Polygon-compatible wallet address in checksum format (`0x...`). |
| `ADMIN_WALLETS` | Grants access to the admin dashboard. | Comma-separated list of wallet addresses for trusted operators. |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_REOWN_APPKIT_PROJECT_ID` | Enables wallet logins through Reown (WalletConnect). | Copy from the [Reown dashboard](https://dashboard.reown.com/). |
| `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` | Master secret for Better Auth during login flows. | Generate a 32-character value in the [Better Auth docs](https://www.better-auth.com/docs/installation#set-environment-variables). |
| `CRON_SECRET` | Secures scheduled Vercel cron jobs. | Create any random string with at least 16 characters. |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_NAME` / `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_DESCRIPTION` | Controls the branding used in headings and SEO metadata. | Set to the public name and tagline for your fork. |

<Callout type="info">
  The default subgraph URLs (`ACTIVITY_SUBGRAPH_URL`, `PNL_SUBGRAPH_URL`) point to Forkast-managed endpoints. Change them only if you host your own infrastructure.
</Callout>

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_DISCORD_LINK`: adds a support CTA across the interface when set.
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_ANALYTICS`: enables analytics without code changes.
