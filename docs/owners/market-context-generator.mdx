## How to enable

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ### Create an OpenRouter API key

    Visit <a href="https://openrouter.ai/settings/keys" target="_blank">OpenRouter -> API Keys</a>, generate a key, and copy it. Models that support live browsing (for example `perplexity/sonar`) deliver richer context.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    ### Configure it in the admin panel

    Navigate to **Admin â†’ Market Context**, paste the API key, and flip the toggle on. The settings are stored in the `settings` table so every deploy stays in sync.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    ### Pick a model (optional)

    Use the model dropdown to select a specific OpenRouter model or leave it on **Let OpenRouter decide** to allow the provider to pick the best option. Saving the form also lets you refine the prompt template.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    ### Enable the Market Context generator

    With the toggle on and the key stored, the generator becomes available in event pages. Disable the toggle anytime to suspend the integration without losing your key.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Using free plans

<Callout type="warning">
  Running live context on the free tier is not recommended for production - keep it to demos or local testing.
</Callout>

If you rely on OpenRouter's free tier:

1. Visit <a href="https://openrouter.ai/settings/privacy" target="_blank">Settings -> Privacy</a>.
2. Enable **Enable free endpoints that may publish prompts**. Without this toggle the free online models won't return responses.
3. Revisit the policy periodically - free endpoints can publish prompts publicly.

When you upgrade to a paid plan you can disable that permission and switch models if needed.
