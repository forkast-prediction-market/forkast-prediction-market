<Callout>
  This track is for teams launching a fork of {process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_NAME}. We keep it focused on the decisions that usually block a successful deploy.
</Callout>

## High-level flow

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ### Fork the repository

    Create the fork on GitHub and keep the project name short so it is easy to locate from Vercel.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    ### Import into Vercel

    From the Vercel dashboard choose **Add New -> Project**, connect GitHub, and select your fork. The first build can fail until secrets are available.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    ### Provision Supabase

    Use the integration under **Storage -> Supabase** to create and link a database to the project.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    ### Load environment variables

    Update `.env.example` locally and import it under **Settings -> Environment Variables** so the deploy has everything it needs.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    ### Deploy and enable sync

    Trigger the deploy once secrets are in place and enable GitHub Actions so the fork stays aligned with upstream updates.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    ### Add optional integrations

    Configure the Market Context generator via OpenRouter only if you need AI-based summaries.
  </Step>
</Steps>
