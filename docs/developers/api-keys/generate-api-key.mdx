## Create a key from the dashboard

Navigate to `Settings > Developer` and click `Create new key`. Give the key a descriptive name for the service that will use it.

## Store the secret securely

Keys are shown only once. Copy the secret value into your secrets manager before closing the modal.

## Rotate on a schedule

Set reminders to rotate credentials regularly and revoke keys you no longer need.
