## JavaScript quick start

Use the official SDK to initialize a client and list markets in under ten lines of code.

## Python quick start

Install `forkast-sdk` from npm via `pip` using `pip install forkast-sdk` and authenticate with your API key to place test orders.

## Environment configuration

Store API keys in environment variables such as `FORKAST_API_KEY` to keep credentials out of source control.
