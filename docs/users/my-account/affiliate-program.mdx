## Share your referral link

Every account receives a personal referral link inside **My Account → Affiliate**.
When someone signs up or connects a wallet using your link, they become your referral.

Your dashboard shows:

- **Referrals** – total number of invited accounts
- **Active traders** – referrals who placed trades
- **Referred volume** – USDC traded by your referrals
- **Earned fees** – commissions you have already received

## Commission structure

The affiliate program pays you a portion of the trading fee your referrals generate:

- Current platform trading fee: **<TradingFeeDisplay />** per fill
- Your commission: **<AffiliateShareDisplay /> of that trading fee** on every qualifying trade (the current live setting)

<FeeCalculationExample amount={1000} format="inline" />

## When you get paid

- Commissions accrue instantly as each referral trade settles
- You can track earnings in the Affiliate dashboard and withdraw them just like normal trading profits
- If a referral reverses a trade (cancellation/refund), the commission adjusts automatically

## Program updates

Admins can occasionally adjust the trading fee or the affiliate share for promotions.
Whenever a change happens, the dashboard shows the updated percentages so you always know what you’ll earn before sharing your link.
