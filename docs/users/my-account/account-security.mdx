## Login methods

You can sign in using **social accounts** or a **crypto wallet** (via Reown).
- Social logins: enable **Two-Factor Auth** for extra protection
- Wallet logins: your walletâ€™s **private key** controls access

---

## Best practices

- Verify the website URL before logging in
- Never share recovery phrases or private keys
- Use hardware wallets for larger balances
- Review and revoke unused app permissions periodically
