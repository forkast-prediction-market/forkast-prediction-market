## Enable two-factor authentication

Enable 2FA from the settings screen to require a one-time code alongside your password or wallet signature.

## Backup recovery codes

Store generated recovery codes offline. They let you regain access if you lose a device.

## Recognize trusted devices

Review your list of trusted devices periodically and revoke any sessions you do not recognize.
