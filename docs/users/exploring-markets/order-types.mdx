## Types of Orders

{process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_NAME} supports two primary order types:

<Accordions type="single" collapsible>
  <Accordion title="Market orders" value="market">
    <p>
      Execute immediately at the best available price in the order book. Choose
      this when you value speed and certainty of execution.
    </p>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Limit orders" value="limit">
    <p>
      Set the exact price you are willing to pay or accept. The order remains
      open until another trader matches it, making limits ideal for precise
      pricing or larger trades.
    </p>
  </Accordion>
</Accordions>
