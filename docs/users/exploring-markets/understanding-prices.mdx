## Price as Probability

Each share is priced between **$0 and $1**:

- A price of $0.70 means the market estimates a **70% chance** the outcome is true.
- A price of $0.20 means a **20% chance**.

---

## How Payouts Work

- If the outcome resolves as true → each share pays **$1**
- If false → shares pay **$0**

**Example:**
You buy 100 “Yes” shares at $0.40.
- Cost = $40
- If “Yes” wins, payout = $100 → profit = $60
- If “No” wins, payout = $0

## Why Prices Move

Prices change as traders buy and sell:
- High demand for “Yes” pushes price up
- More “No” sellers push price down

This continuous trading updates the **real-time probability** shown in the market.
