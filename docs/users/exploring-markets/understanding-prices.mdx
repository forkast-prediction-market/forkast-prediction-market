## Price equals probability

Market prices represent the crowd-implied probability that an outcome will resolve as true.

## Why prices move

New information, trading volume, and liquidity provision shift prices as traders adjust their expectations.

## Track implied returns

Use the probability to gauge potential upside. Lower probabilities often mean higher possible payouts if the outcome wins.
