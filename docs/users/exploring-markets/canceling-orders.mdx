## Where to find open orders

Open the `Open Orders` tab on a market page or in your portfolio view to review pending orders.

## Cancel an order

Select the order and click `Cancel`. Confirm the transaction in your wallet to free the reserved funds.

## Partial fills

If an order is partially filled, canceling removes only the remaining unfilled portion.
