## Current platform fee

- **Default rate:** <TradingFeeDisplay /> per trade pulled from the affiliate settings.
- **Configurable range:** Admins can raise the fee up to 9.00% from **Admin → Affiliate**.
- **Rounding:** Fees are rounded to 6 decimal places when recorded on-chain.

<Callout type="info" title="How the math works">
  Trading fee (USDC) = Order notional × <TradingFeeDisplay />.
  A 150 USDC fill at the current rate costs <FeeCalculationExample amount={150} format="inline" /> in fees.
</Callout>

## Maker vs taker

- **Market orders** consume liquidity and always pay the full trading fee.
- **Limit orders** incur the fee only when executed. There is no rebate program today, so makers and takers pay the same rate.

Fee estimates appear directly in the order ticket before you sign the transaction.

## Revenue split

Trading fees are shared with referring affiliates:

- **Affiliate share:** <AffiliateShareDisplay /> of the trading fee (current configuration)
- **Platform share:** <PlatformShareDisplay /> of the trading fee

If an order has no associated affiliate, the platform retains 100% of the fee.

## Where to review fees

- **Order preview:** Displays the estimated fee alongside the net cost or proceeds.
- **Portfolio → History:** Lists the precise fee debited for each fill.
- **Settings → Affiliate:** Shows the current basis-point configuration and when it was last updated.
