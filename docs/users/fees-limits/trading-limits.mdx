## Position size caps

Each market defines a maximum position size to manage risk and liquidity.

## Daily volume limits

Aggregate trading over a 24-hour period counts toward your daily cap. Exceeding it requires additional verification.

## Raising limits

Complete identity checks or reach out to support to request higher limits for institutional trading.
