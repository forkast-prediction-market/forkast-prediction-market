  <Accordion title="What fees do I pay when I trade?" value="fees">
    <p>
      Each trade includes a <strong>1% protocol fee</strong> plus the platform’s
      trading fee (currently 1%). Part of the platform fee can be shared with
      affiliates, and the exact amount appears before you confirm any order.

  <Accordion title="How long do deposits take?" value="deposit">
    <p>
      Crypto deposits usually confirm within minutes, depending on network
      congestion. Fiat on-ramps can take several hours or up to two business days
      based on your provider.

  <Accordion title="What if I disagree with a market resolution?" value="dispute">
    <p>
      Use the <strong>Dispute</strong> button on the market page during the listed
      dispute window. You’ll stake a small fee and must supply verifiable
      evidence; valid disputes receive the stake back.

  <Accordion title="Are there withdrawal limits?" value="withdraw">
    <p>
      Crypto withdrawals are generally unlimited. Fiat withdrawals may have
      provider-specific limits, and all requests are processed as quickly as
      possible.
