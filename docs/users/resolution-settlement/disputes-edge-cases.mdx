## Disputing a Resolution

In rare cases, you may believe a market was resolved incorrectly.

{process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_NAME} provides a **dispute process** to ensure fairness.

## How Disputes Work

<Steps>
  <Step>
    <h3 className="!mt-0">Submit a dispute</h3>
    <p>
      Use the <strong>Dispute</strong> button within the window shown on the market
      page to challenge the posted outcome.
    </p>
  </Step>
  <Step>
    <h3 className="!mt-0">Stake the dispute fee</h3>
    <p>
      Provide the required stake to prevent spam submissions. Valid disputes
      receive that stake back once the case is resolved.
    </p>
  </Step>
  <Step>
    <h3 className="!mt-0">Await review and final decision</h3>
    <p>
      Moderators evaluate the evidence, cross-check official sources, and apply
      the final resolution. The market updates automatically after the decision.
    </p>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Important Notes

- If no dispute is submitted during the window, the resolution becomes **final**.  
- Disputes should provide **clear evidence** (official results, public data, or records).  
- Abuse of the dispute process may result in account restrictions.
