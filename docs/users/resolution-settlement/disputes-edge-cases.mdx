## Disputing a Resolution

In rare cases, you may believe a market was resolved incorrectly.

{process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_NAME} provides a **dispute process** to ensure fairness.

---

## How Disputes Work

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ### Submit a dispute

    Use the <strong>Dispute</strong> button within the window shown on the market
    page to challenge the posted outcome.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    ### Stake the dispute fee

    Provide the required stake to prevent spam submissions. Valid disputes
    receive that stake back once the case is resolved.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    ### Await review and final decision

    Moderators evaluate the evidence, cross-check official sources, and apply
    the final resolution. The market updates automatically after the decision.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Important Notes

- If no dispute is submitted during the window, the resolution becomes **final**.
- Disputes should provide **clear evidence** (official results, public data, or records).
- Abuse of the dispute process may result in account restrictions.
