## ✨ Core Benefits

Tired of centralized platforms? Want to build your own business in the DeFi space? This project offers you:

- **🛠️ Hassle-Free & Transparent:** Infrastructure is managed for you, while you keep full control over the code and operations. Focus on growing your community and contributing to a decentralized ecosystem.
- **💸 Arbitrage Opportunities:** Your users can profit from price differences between your platform and other prediction markets like Polymarket, creating natural trading volume and liquidity.
- **⚡ Built on Polygon:** Fast transactions with minimal fees, ideal for traders and scaling your market.
- **🗳️ Fair Event Resolution (via UMA/Oracles):** A global voting area ensures fairness and security of results.
